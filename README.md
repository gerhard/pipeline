Workshop materials for **A pipeline to get you excited, London Ruby Unconference 2017**

http://pipeline.gerhard.io

## Summary

A hands-on training workshop where you will learn to visualise the code release
process as a pipeline and experience the possibilities that this concept
unlocks.

You will start by building a simple pipeline that will continuously deploy a
web app. Within minutes, you will make it production-ready, meaning:

* new commits will automatically update your web app
* app will be always available, even as new versions are being deployed
* versions of your app that don't work won't be promoted to live
* 10x scale outs at the click of a button

In the second part of the workshop, you will see examples of pipelines that
perform full production backups and manage entire infrastructures. You will
even experience the most complex and advanced pipelines that deliver big
software at scale.

## Pre-requisites
