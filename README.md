Workshop materials for **A pipeline to get you excited, London Ruby Unconference 2017**

## Summary

A hands-on training workshop where you will learn to visualise the code release
process as a pipeline and experience the possibilities that this concept
unlocks.

We will start by building a simple pipeline that will continuously deploy a
Rails app. Within minutes, we will add zero-downtime deploys, tests, database
migrations, and finish-off with auto-updates.

In the second part of the workshop, we will see examples of pipelines that
perform full production backups and manage entire infrastructures. We will
finish off with the most complex and advanced pipelines that deliver big
software at scale.

## System Requirements

* Linux, Windows or OS X (all 64bit)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) client installed with Command Prompt / Terminal support
